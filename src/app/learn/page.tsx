        title: 'What Are Surplus Funds?',
        content: `When a property is sold at a tax sale or foreclosure auction for more than the amount owed in taxes, liens, or mortgage debt, the difference is called "surplus funds," "excess proceeds," or "overbid." This money legally belongs to the former property owner (or their heirs), not the county or the buyer.

For example: If a homeowner owes $5,000 in back taxes and their property sells at auction for $80,000, the $75,000 difference is surplus. The county holds this money and the former owner has the right to claim it.`,

      {
        title: 'Types of Surplus Funds',
        content: `**Tax Sale Surplus (Excess Proceeds):** Generated when tax-delinquent property sells for more than the tax lien amount. Most common in CA, FL, TX, GA, and OH.

**Foreclosure Surplus (Overbid):** When a foreclosed property sells at sheriff's sale or trustee sale for more than the outstanding mortgage plus fees.

**Municipal/Code Enforcement Surplus:** Rare, but can occur when a municipality demolishes or sells a property for code violations.

**HOA Foreclosure Surplus:** When a homeowners association forecloses on a property for unpaid assessments.`,

      {
        title: 'Why Do Surplus Funds Go Unclaimed?',
        content: `Billions of dollars in surplus funds sit unclaimed across the US because:
• Former owners don't know the funds exist
• Owners moved and didn't update their address with the county
• The owner passed away and heirs don't know about the surplus
• People assume the county keeps everything from a tax sale
• The notification process (often a single letter or newspaper notice) is inadequate
• Some owners are confused by the legal process and give up

**This creates an opportunity** for asset recovery professionals who locate these funds, find the rightful owners, and help them file claims — earning a percentage as compensation.`,

        title: 'Where to Find Surplus Funds Lists',
        content: `**County Government Websites:** Most counties publish surplus funds lists on their Treasurer, Tax Collector, or Clerk of Court websites. Our [County Directory](/directory) links directly to these pages for 90+ counties.

**Google Dork Searches:** Use targeted search queries to find county surplus pages. Our [Google Dork Tool](/dorks) generates state-specific searches. Example: \`site:*.gov "excess proceeds" county filetype:pdf\`

**State Unclaimed Property Portals:** Many states have centralized databases:
• California: sco.ca.gov
• Texas: claimittexas.gov
• Florida: fltreasurehunt.gov
• New York: osc.state.ny.us
• North Carolina: nccash.com

**Court Records:** Foreclosure surplus is often listed in court records. Check the Clerk of Court website for your target county.

**Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):** If a county doesn't publish their list online, you can request it via FOIA/public records request.`,

        title: 'Evaluating Surplus Funds Leads',
        content: `Not every surplus listing is worth pursuing. Evaluate based on:

**Amount:** Focus on surplus amounts above $2,000. Below that, the time investment may not be worthwhile after fees and costs.

**Age:** Newer surplus (within the last 1-2 years) is easier to claim. Older claims may have expired deadlines.

**Owner Traceability:** Can you find the former owner? Names like "LLC" or "Trust" are harder to trace than individual names.

**State/County Rules:** Some states have very short claim windows (FL: 120 days). Others have no deadline. Know the rules before investing time.

**Competition:** Popular counties (LA County, Miami-Dade) have more competition from other recovery agents. Rural counties often have untouched surplus.`,

      {
        title: 'Skip Tracing Fundamentals',
        content: `"Skip tracing" is the process of locating a person. For surplus funds recovery, you need to find the former property owner or their heirs.

**Step 1 — Start with what you know:** The surplus funds list gives you the former owner's name and property address. The property address is their last known location.

**Step 2 — Public records search:** Use our [OSINT Tools](/osint) to search:
• People search databases (name + last known city/state)
• Address history (find where they moved)
• Phone number lookup
• Email verification
• Social media / username search

**Step 3 — Property records:** Check the county assessor for the new owner of the property. Sometimes the former owner bought another property in the same county.

**Step 4 — Court records:** If the owner passed away, probate records will list heirs and executors.

**Step 5 — Mailing:** Send a letter to their last known address AND their current address (if different). Even if they moved, the post office may forward mail for up to 1 year.`,

        title: 'Heir Research',
        content: `If the former property owner is deceased, their heirs have the right to claim the surplus. Research steps:

1. **Obituary search** — Confirms death and often lists surviving family members
2. **Probate records** — Filed in the county where the person died. Lists executor and beneficiaries.
3. **Social Security Death Index** — Confirms date of death
4. **Property records** — If the property was transferred before the tax sale, the transferee may have a claim
5. **Family tree databases** — Ancestry.com, FamilySearch.org for identifying heirs

**Important:** If there was a will, the executor or named heirs have priority. If there was no will (intestate), state law determines the heir hierarchy (typically: spouse → children → parents → siblings).`,

**California** — Rev & Tax Code §4675-4676. 1 year from deed recording. Filed with County Treasurer-Tax Collector. Board of Supervisors must approve.

**Texas** — Tax Code §34.04. 2 years from tax sale. Requires a court petition (lawsuit) filed with District Clerk. Attorney usually needed.

**Florida** — Stat §197.522. Only 120 days from tax deed issuance. Filed with Clerk of Circuit Court. Very short window.

**Georgia** — Code §48-4-5. 1 year from tax sale. Filed with Tax Commissioner. After 1 year, funds may escheat to state.

**Michigan** — Comp. Laws §211.78t. After the 2023 Rafaeli Supreme Court decision, counties must return ALL surplus from tax foreclosures.

**Ohio** — Rev. Code §5723.12. No specific deadline. Filed with County Auditor or Treasurer.

        title: 'Common Legal Pitfalls',
        content: `**Missed deadlines:** The #1 reason claims fail. Always verify the claim deadline BEFORE starting work on a case.

**Insufficient documentation:** Each county has specific document requirements. Get the complete list before filing.

**Lien priority:** If there were liens on the property (IRS, mortgage, mechanic's liens), those may have priority over the former owner's claim.

**Assignment rules:** Some states restrict or regulate how recovery agents can acquire rights. Always use a proper assignment agreement.

**Unauthorized practice of law (UPL):** In most states, you can file claims and assist with paperwork. But giving legal advice, appearing in court, or drafting legal documents may constitute UPL. Know the line.

**Fee regulations:** While most states don't cap recovery agent fees, some counties or courts may review for "reasonableness." Keep fees in line with industry standards (25-40%).`,

• Government-issued photo ID
• Proof of ownership (recorded deed, title report)
• Tax sale documentation (sale date, parcel number, amount)
• Notarized affidavit (if required)
• Assignment of rights (if filing on behalf of owner)

**Step 3 — Complete the form.** Use our [Letter Templates](/templates) for professional formatting.

**Step 4 — Submit to the correct office.** Each state uses a different office:
• CA: County Treasurer-Tax Collector
• TX: District Clerk (requires court petition)
• FL: Clerk of Circuit Court
• GA: Tax Commissioner
• OH: County Auditor/Treasurer

• Clear identification of both parties
• Description of the specific surplus funds being assigned
• The percentage or fee you'll receive
• A statement that the assignor is transferring their right to claim
• Signatures of both parties (notarized is best)
• Date of the agreement
• A cancellation clause (typically 3 business days)

**Important:** Always disclose your fee upfront. Never misrepresent yourself as a government official. Keep copies of all signed agreements.

Use our [Assignment Agreement Template](/templates) as a starting point, but have an attorney review it for your state.`,

        title: 'Business Model & Economics',

**Costs to consider:**
• Skip tracing tools ($50-200/month)
• Mailing costs ($1-5 per letter)
• Filing fees ($0-400 depending on state)
• Notary fees ($10-25 per document)
• Legal consultation ($200-500 per case if needed)

**Use our [Calculator](/calculator)** to estimate costs and fees for specific claims.

**Volume matters:** Most successful recovery agents work 20-50+ cases simultaneously. Even with a 30-40% success rate, the math works because the revenue per case is significant.

**Ideal client profile:**
• Surplus amount: $3,000-$50,000
• State with favorable laws and reasonable timelines
• Owner is locatable via public records
• Claim deadline hasn't passed
• No competing claims filed`,

**Phase 2 — Build Pipeline (Months 2-3):** Use our tools to build a pipeline of 20+ active cases. Send outreach letters to located owners. Track everything in the [Claim Tracker](/claims).

**Phase 3 — Systemize (Months 4-6):** Create standard operating procedures. Use templates for all correspondence. Set up follow-up schedules.

**Phase 4 — Scale (Month 6+):** Expand to more states. Consider hiring assistants for skip tracing and mailing. Build relationships with attorneys in your target states for TX-style court petitions.

**Keys to success:**
• Focus on rural and mid-size counties (less competition)
• Always be professional and transparent with property owners
• Track every case meticulously
• Know the law in every state you operate in
• Build a reputation — referrals are valuable`,

• Keep all client information confidential
• Follow all state and federal laws

**DON'T:**
• Misrepresent yourself as a government employee

☐ **Assignment agreement review** — Have your template reviewed by an attorney
☐ **Fee compliance** — Verify there are no fee caps in your target state/county
☐ **UPL boundaries** — Understand what constitutes legal advice vs. administrative assistance
☐ **FTC compliance** — Follow Federal Trade Commission rules for commercial communications
☐ **Do-Not-Call list** — Check the National Do Not Call Registry before making phone calls
☐ **CAN-SPAM Act** — Follow email marketing rules if doing email outreach
☐ **State consumer protection** — Review your state's consumer protection statutes
☐ **Record keeping** — Maintain records of all client interactions for at least 3 years`,
